Even though you say all configurations are correct cross check these settings. Whenever you are using SPI in master mode :

1- Master mode bit must be enabled in the configuration register. 
2- Ensure that SPI peripheral enable bit is enabled in the control register.
3- SPI peripheral clock must be enabled. By default clocks to almost all peripheral in the microcontroller will be disabled by default.

Some of the common problems that occurred in the SPI protocol and how to resolve them:

Case 1 --->> Master cannot able to produce clock and data:
---------------------------------------------------------

There could be 2 strong reasons for this problem:
Reason_1) The GPIOs which you use for clock and MOSI functionality are not configured properly for SPI functionality.
__Debug Tip__: Recheck the GPIO alternate function register to see, whether a particular GPIO pin is configured for alternate functionality or not.

Reason_2) configuration overriding. Even though you have configured all the registers properly,when you are involved in a bigger project
there may be chance that registers are overridden by some other code.
__Debug Tip__: Dump out all the required register contents just before you begin the transmission.


Case 2 --->> Master is sending data, but slave is not receiving any data:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reason_1) Not pulling down the slave select pin to ground before sending data to the slave.If the slave select pin is not pulled down
slave SPI pins will be in floating or Hi-Z state. So, they don't respond for any data communication.
__Debug Tip__: Probe through the logic analyzer to confirm slave select line is really low during data communication.

Reason_2) Non enabling the peripheral IRQ number in the NVIC.
__Debug Tip__: Check the NVIC interrupt mask register.

Case 3 --->> SPI interrupts are not getting triggered:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reason_1) Not enabling the TXE or RXNE interrupt in the SPI configuration register.
__Debug Tip__: Check the SPI configuration register to see TXEIE and RXNEIE bits are really set to enable the interrupt.
