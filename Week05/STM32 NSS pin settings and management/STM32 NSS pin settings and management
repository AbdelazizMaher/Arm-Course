When a device is slave:
      In slave mode, the NSS works as a standard "Chip SELECT" input and lets the slave communicates with master.
      
When a device is master:
      In master mode, the NSS can be either used as output or input.As an input it can prevent multi-master bus collision, and as an output it 
      can drive a single slave.
      
There are 2 types of slave managment:
      1) Hardware slave managment
      2) Software slave managment
