The SPI allows the MCU to communicate using different configurations,depending on the device targeted and the application requirments:
       1) Full Duplex communication
       2) Half Duplex communication
       3) Simplex communication 

MISO and MOSI lines are connected to a shift register.

The shift register can be 8-bit or 16-bit according to the MCU.

The shift register is connected to 2 buffers that can be accessed through Address and Data bus(APB):
          1) RX buffer: When the shift register recieves 1 complete data, then the data will be moved to it,and form it you can read the data.
          2) TX buffer: When yoy write data it is wrote to the TX buffer,when it recieves 1 complete data(if the shift register is not busy), then the data will be moved 
          to the shift register.

The Clock pin is controlled by a Baud Rate Generator if the peripheral is master.
