SPI communication format:
    1) SCLK PHASE (CPHA)
    2) SCLK POLARITY (CPOL)
    2) DATA FRAME FORMATE
    
During SPI communication, recieve and transmit operations are performed simultaneously .

The serial clock(SCLK) synchronizes the shifting and sampling of the information on the data lines.

The communication format depends on the clock phase,the clock polarity, and the data frame format.

CPOL: 1) It controls the idle state value of the clock when no data is being transfered.
      2) If it is reset, the SCLK pin has a low-level idle state. if it is set, the SCLK pin has a high-level idle state.
      
CPHA: 1)It controls at which clock edge of the SCLK (1st or 2nd) the data should be sampled by the slave.
      2) The combination between CPOL and CPHA bits selects the data capture clock edge. 
      
If CPHA ==1 ----> Data will be sampled on the trailing-edge of the clock.      

If CPHA ==0 ----> Data will be sampled on the leading-edge of the clock.
