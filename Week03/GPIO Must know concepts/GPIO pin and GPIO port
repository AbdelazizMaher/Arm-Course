GPIO is abbreviation of General Purpose Input Output

GPIOs can be used for issuing intterupts,reading digital signals,generating triggers for external components,
waking up the processor and many more. 

GPIO port is nothing but a collection of fixed numbers of I/O pins

If port A consists of 16 pins, we can say port A is 16 bit wide, and each pin refers to a corresponding bit of GPIO port register.

Register details should be known from the refrence manual not the datasheet.
