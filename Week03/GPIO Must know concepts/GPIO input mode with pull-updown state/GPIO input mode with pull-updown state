Floating state is avoided by introducing an internal pull up/pull down resistors.

There are configuration registers for eavry GPIIO port which enable you to handle internal pull up/pull down resistors.

It is always safe to keep the unused GPIO pin in one of the states so that they are reluctant to voltage fluctuations which may lead to current leakage.
