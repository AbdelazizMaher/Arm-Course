High impedance is also called HI-Z state.

HI-Z state of an I/O pin is keeping pin floating by not connecting to either high or low voltage.

After powering up the MCU, by default all the GPIO pins will be in input mode with HI-Z state or floating state.
It can lead to current leakage which may lead to higher power consumption.
