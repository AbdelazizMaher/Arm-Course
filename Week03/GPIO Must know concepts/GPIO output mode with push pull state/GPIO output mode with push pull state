This is the default configuration when the pin is made output.

In the push/pull configuration you don't need an internal or external pull up or pulldown  resistor.

It actually uses two transistors, each will be ON to drive the output to the appropiate level .

The top transistor (Pmos) will be ON when the output has to be HIGH.

The BOTTOM transistor (Nmos) will be ON when the output has to be LOW.
