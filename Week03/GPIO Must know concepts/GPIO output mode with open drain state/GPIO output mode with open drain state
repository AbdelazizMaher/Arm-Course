Output mode with open drain configuration is nothing but the top pmos transistor simply not present.

When the transistor is switched ON, the output will be pulled to LOW.

When the transistor is switched OFF, the drain will be open, hence the output will be floating.

So open drain configuration can only pull down the pin, it can't pull up the pin.

It provides 2 states:
                   1) GND state
                   2)Floating state

The open drain output configuration of  a GPIO is useless until you provide the pull up capability.
