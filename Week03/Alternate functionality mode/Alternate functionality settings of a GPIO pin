Alternative functionality mode:
-when a GPIO is in alternative functionality mode it can be used for 16 different functionalites

A table that contains all the supported alternative functionality for each GPIO pin:
1-Go to the datasheet
2-pinout and pin description
3-Alternate function mapping

There are two registers in order to configure the alternative function needed for any application:
1-GPIO Alternative function high register (GPIOx AFRH)(x=A.I/J)
2-GPIO Alternative function low register (GPIOx AFRl)(x=A.I/J/K)

each register is divided to 8 groups a total of 16 groups
each group is divided into 4 bits
