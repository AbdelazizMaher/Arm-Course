Inter-Integrated Circuit(I2C) Protocol.Pronounced as "I squared C" or "I two C".

What is the I2C protocol?
      - It is just a protocol to achieve serial data communication between integrated circuits which are very close to each other.(But more serious protocol 
       than SPI because the companies have come forward to design a specification).
       
      - The I2C protocol details(how data should be sent, how data should be received, how hand shaking should happen between sender and  receiver, error handling)
       are complex than SPI( in other words SPI is actually a very simple protocol compared to I2C).
       
differences between SPI and I2C protocol:
       1- I2C is based on dedicated specification. The spec is designed by NXP.For SPI there is no dedicated spec.
       2- Multi master capability. I2C potocol is multi master capable, whereas SPI has no guidelines to achieve multi master capability.
       3- ACKing. I2C hardware automatically ACKs every byte received.SPI does not support any automatic ACKing.
       4- I2C needs just 2 pins for the communication between master and slaves, whereas SPI may need  4 pins and even more than that if multiple slaves are involved.
       5- Addressing.I2C master talks to slaves based on slave addresses,while in SPI a dedicated pin will be used to select the slave.
       6- I2C is half duplex, but as SPI is full duplex.
       7- SPI is actually very very fast compared to I2C.

Both SDA and SCL are bidirectional lines connected to  positive supply voltage via pull-up resistors. When the bus is free,both the lines are held at high.

The output stages of devices connected to the bus must have an open drain or open collector configuration. 

The bus capacitance limits the number of interfaces connected to the bus.

When the bus is idle, both SDA and SCL are pulled to Vdd.
