Data transfer is always initiated by the master on the SDA line, master initiates the data transfer by first producing the start condition."this is called as start condition"

 After the start condition the address phase follows. The address phase is of 8 bits.
 
 In the address phase, first 7 bits are actually the address of the slave. And the remaining one bit is actually decides the read or write operation."RW bar or read/write"
            - If this bit is 0, that indicates that master is going to write the data or master is going to transmit the data.
            - And if this bit is 1, then it indicates that master is going to read the data from the slave.
 
Every byte put on SDA line must be 8 bits long. You cannot put 7 bits,you cannot put 16 bits like that. You have to put 1 byte.

Each byte must be followed by an acknowledge bit. Once the 8 bits are sent in the address phase slave is going to receive this and slave is going 
to match its own address with a 7 bit slave address sent. If there is any match then slave is going to send this ACK. 
This is a ACK which is sent by the slave.So, master receives the ACK here. So, once master receives the ACK so it is going to do write operation.

When master decides to close the communication with the slave, then master generates the STOP condition. This is a STOP condition which is generated
by the master to close the communication.

Once the STOP condition is generated, master has no control over the bus and some other master can initiate the data transfer.
