Some points to remember:
---------------------------

1-START and STOP conditions are always generated by the master.

2- The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition.The bus is considered to be free again a certain time after the STOP condition.

3- When the bus is free another master(if present) can get the chance to claim the bus for data communication.

4- The bus stays busy if repeated START is generated instead of a STOP condition.

5- Most of the MCU's I2C peripherals support both master and slave mode.You need not to configure the mode because, when the peripheral
generates the START condition it automatically becomes the master and when it generates the STOP condition it goes back to slave mode.
