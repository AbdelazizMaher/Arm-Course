In Standard Mode communication:
              1- Data transfer rate can reach up to a maximum of 100 kilo bits per second.
              2- Was the very first mode introduced when the first I2C specification was released.
              3- Standard mode devices are not upward compatible and they cannot communicate with devices of fast mode or above.
              
In Fast Mode communication:
              1- Fast mode devices can receive and transmit data up to 400 kilo bits per second 
              2- Fast mode devices are downward compatible and can communicate with standard mode devices in a 0 to 100 Kbits/s I2C bus system.
